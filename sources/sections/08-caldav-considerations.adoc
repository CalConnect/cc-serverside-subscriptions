== CalDAV service Considerations

As mentioned above, this feature is particularly useful for CalDAV servers and
clients. There are some specific considerations.

=== Deleted events

If subscription-deletions-suppressed is specified then the server SHOULD retain
all events. However, the server MAY choose to remove old events once they become
older than the CALDAV:min-date-time property as specified in
<<RFC4791,section=5.2.6>>.

=== CalDAV restrictions

A server SHOULD apply all appropriate restrictions on events obtained from a
subscription. In particular the CALDAV:min-date-time and CALDAV:max-date-time
properties as specified in <<RFC4791,section=5.2.6>> and
<<RFC4791,section=5.2.7>> SHOULD be applied.

Additionally the CALDAV:max-resource-size property restricts the size of events
and the CALDAV:max-instances property the number of instances.

=== Invitations in Subscriptions

Any reason not to allow them?
