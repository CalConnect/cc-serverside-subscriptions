== Refreshing and Reenabling the subscription

When creating the subscription the client may indicate to the server a desired
refresh interval using the subscription-suggested-refresh-interval property.

The client may indicate to the server that a refresh of the data is desired by
using the PROPPATCH method to set the subscription-next-refresh-interval to 0,
e.g. "PT0S".

A server MAY choose to always ignore the attempted refresh or to ignore the
patch if it appears too often.

If the server decides to initiate a refresh it MAY choose to respond with a 102
HTTP status indicating that it is still waiting for the data or a 202 HTTP
status to indicate the request was accepted.
