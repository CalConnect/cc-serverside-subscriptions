== Introduction

The motivation for this specification was initially to handle external subscriptions to calendar
data. However, any resource which allows subscriptions might make use of this specification.

Currently subscriptions to calendar feeds are handled by calendar clients. There are a number of
disadvantages to this approach: users have to subscribe from multiple devices and the
subscription cannot affect scheduling handled by the server.

This specification defines a mechanism whereby the server will subscribe to the feed and make it
visible in the user's home.

The advantages are popular feeds can be cached by the server and the user only has to make a
single subscription.
